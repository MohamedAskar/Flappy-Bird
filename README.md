# Flappy Bird with Python (PyOpenGL)


In this project we recreate the famous game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) usnig OpenGL libraries and Python programming language.

## Introduction

With the help of [BEKA Engine](https://github.com/MwEg777/BEKA-Engine). We were able to recreate our version of Flappy Bird with some tweaks added to make the game more enjoyable.
### Note: PyGame is required to load images and sounds.
